# PowerShell



## Purpose ##

The purpose of these exercises is to demonstrate how PowerShell scripts can be used to automate the configuration of a Windows Server.

## What the scripts can be used for: ##
Scripts 1 - 4 are used to install and verify PowerShell version 7 on a computer.

Scripts 5 - 7 are used to find what modules are installed and how to create one.
The 'PowerShell Remote Control' directory contains scripts to set up a Windows Domain Controller (including services like Active Directory, DNS, DHCP), import users into Active Directory from a CSV file (an additional instruction document is also included), and how to setup a second Windows core server as an additional domain controller.

In the directory 'PowerShell Variables and Loops' there are some simple scripts to demonstrate the syntax for 'If', Tests, Types, Variables, Loops (ForEach, While, Do/Until) and 'switch' functions.

In the directory W2019 DSC there is a script to apply Desired State Configuration (DSC) to a server.
